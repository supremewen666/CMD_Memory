# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Project Summary

CMD frames agent-memory failure diagnosis as counterfactual attribution:

```text
failed memory task
  -> baseline memory answer + evidence score
  -> 10 counterfactual memory-operation replays
  -> recovery gains scored by phrase fallback or LLM SubagentScorer
  -> operation-level attribution + close_deltas
  -> ECS draft
  -> RepairExecutor / RepairOrchestrator
  -> Post-Repair Context Replay
  -> Failure Memory for future similar failures
```

The first milestone is a standalone **CMD-Audit** harness that produces attribution and repair-validation evidence. V0, V1, and V2 together constitute a single paper, with V2 as the final module/skill. After Decision 34 (2026-05-23), paper headline claims bind to a 130-case researcher-adjudicated set; the 596-case suite is a scale sanity check, the hook is supplementary, and CMD vs Rewind head-to-head is dropped in favor of layered positioning.

## Required Reading

Before changing plans or code, read:

1. `cmd_innovation_core/README.md`
2. `CONTEXT.md` — domain language, boundaries, label taxonomy
3. `knowledge/current-memory.md` — compressed active memory
4. `cmd_innovation_core/issues/README.md`
5. `cmd_innovation_core/gates/V1V2_gate_status.md`
6. `TASK.md`

## Commands

Python >= 3.11, zero external PyPI dependencies. Tests use `unittest` via `pytest`.

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run a subpackage's tests
python -m pytest tests/repair/ -v
python -m pytest tests/eval/ -v

# Run a single test file
python -m pytest tests/attribution/test_labels_ingestion_route.py -v

# Run a single test method
python -m pytest tests/attribution/test_labels_ingestion_route.py::V1LabelValidationTest::test_v1_labels_are_superset_of_v0 -v

# Run the V0 CMD-Audit CLI harness
python -m cmd_audit run --cases data/probe_cases/v0_issue3_cases.json
```

## Code Architecture

`cmd_audit/` is a standalone research harness with no external PyPI dependencies; `cmd_audit/baselines/` is its comparator subpackage. Modules and data flow:

```
data/probe_cases/*.json
  -> data_io/ loaders
  -> harness.py run_case / run_case_full / run_case_with_hook
    -> baselines/ comparators and memory-probe baseline
    -> replays/ V1 replay portfolio (10 replays)
    -> scoring/ phrase fallback or LLM SubagentScorer
    -> attribution/ recovery-gain label assignment
    -> repair/ ECS + RepairExecutor / RepairOrchestrator + failure_memory
    -> eval/ provenance, writers, metrics, gates

cmd_audit/adapters/
  -> mem0.py / letta.py recorded-trace adapters

cmd_audit/hook/
  -> post_retrieve_hook.py + rpe_judge.py + constants.py
  -> supplementary replay selection and cost-reduction analysis
```

## Domain Rules (coding boundaries)

Full domain language and taxonomy live in `CONTEXT.md`.

## Editing Rules

- Preserve existing research notes unless explicitly asked to rewrite.
- When adding knowledge, update relevant `knowledge/` page and add `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` note.
- Keep `knowledge/topic-cmd-memory-failure.md` compact and information-dense.
- New reference notes format: arXiv ID (or Zenodo/GitHub identifier), core contribution, key concepts, CMD relevance, open gap. One line each.
- When metabolism produces new signals, update `knowledge/topic-cmd-memory-failure.md` with dated signal table and `knowledge/current-memory.md` with incremental conclusions.

## Output Artifacts

Primary artifacts:

- `artifacts/attribution_table*.csv` — per-case predicted label, top-2, recovery gains, comparator outputs.
- `artifacts/attribution_confusion_matrix*.csv` — label confusion matrix for smoke, per-source, or real-data runs.
- `artifacts/comparison_metrics*.csv` — CMD vs evidence-recall / subagent_judge / llm_judge / random baselines.
- `artifacts/sandbox/post_repair_table*.csv` — Post-Repair Context Replay assessment distribution.
- `artifacts/sandbox/repair_success_table*.csv` — targeted repair outcomes.
- `artifacts/sandbox/recurrence_*.csv|txt` — Failure Memory recurrence summaries.
- `data/probe_cases/researcher_labeled_subset.json` — Decision 34 headline adjudication stub.
- `data/probe_cases/experiment_01_inspected_ecs.json` — Experiment 1 ECS inspection stub.

Decision 34 caveat: existing 596-case Macro F1 artifacts are mechanics-validation snapshots until the LLM re-test and researcher adjudication land.
